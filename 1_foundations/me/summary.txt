My name is Enrique de la Rosa Morón. I'm a data scientist, bioinformatician and R/Python developer specialized in AI, machine learning and multi-omics data analysis. I'm originally from Salamanca, Spain, where I built my scientific background in biomedicine and computational biology, and today I work at the intersection of data, healthcare and technology.

I love turning complex biological or business problems into clean, reproducible code and practical models — from single-cell transcriptomics and cancer research to credit risk and production ML systems. I'm especially passionate about combining statistics, machine learning and real-world impact. Outside of work, you’ll probably find me exploring new tools, contributing to GitHub projects, or learning the latest advances in AI and data science.
